1st approach:
we check for loop using set(simple)
2nd approach:
we check for loop using tortoise hare method(floyd's method)
3rd pproach:
every number's sum of digit square either will be 1 or will be 89 at some point and it'll form a loop..
so if we find 1 return true
otherwise if we find 89 return false
