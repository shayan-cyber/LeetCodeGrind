First approach:
sort the array and make a curr variable as curr =1 cause least ans will 1 after that we will iterarte through the array  as it is sorted if we find element equal to curr we progress cur++ and now missing least element till now is curr if we find element greater than this without getting the curr it ensures that curr is misssing
