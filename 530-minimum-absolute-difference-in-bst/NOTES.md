To get min diff we can sort the tree in ascending order..
cause min diff can be found from the diff of two adjacent integers..
we don't need sorting cause if we do inorder traversal of BST it'll be sorted in ascending order. we'll go till last leftest element and maintain prev variable..first prev will be INT_MIN then after the leftest element that will become prev and we will calculate diff from next leftest from the prev var..
