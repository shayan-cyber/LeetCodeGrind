there are two ways to be a subtree..
1. either the subtree matches with whole tree for that we are calling isSametree with root, subRoot inside the isSubtree function .
2. or the left/right subtree of the main tree is same with the given subtree for that we are calling isSubtree twice for each child node(left/right) inside the isSubTree.
