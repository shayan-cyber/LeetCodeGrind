logic :
addition of binary is similar to addition of decimal here sum of two binary digits can be wither 0,1 or 10 for 10 we take 1 as carry and take result as 0..
And
1+1 =10
1+0 = 1
0 + 0 = 1
​
so for binary addition
​
111
+1
will be  :
1 + 1 = 10 so take 1 as carry and put  result  = 0
1(carry) + 1 = 10 so take 1 carry and result =0
1(carry) +1 = 10 so take 1 carry and result =0
now put remaining carry in front
​
ans = 1000(8)
