We'll do binary search to find the parent node ..
the parent node will be the mid of the array..
on left side of the parent it'll have all the elements less than the curr mid (left side)
and vice versa..
so for parent nodes left root will be mid left subarray.
and right root will be mid of right subarray..
Recursion will go on.....
